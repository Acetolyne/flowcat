VERSION 3.0.0

Moved to using a custom lexer to parse files.
Adds ability to parse files with multiple comment styles such as html files that may have html comments as well as javascript comments in a single filetype.
Moves settings file to user home folder instead of per directory as this didn't work well when scanning specific folders within a project.
